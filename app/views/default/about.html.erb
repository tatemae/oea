	  Funded by our friends at MIT, built by the power of <a href="http://www.atomicjolt.com">Atomic Jolt</a>, 
	  and dreamed up by a team of skilled programmers and educators, Open Assessments has come to life in an 
	  effort to increase the quality of education by utilizing the unlimited resources of the web.

	  Open Assessments was founded because we believe the impact of online learning is
	  only beginning to be realized. Passionate  instructors hunger for more dynamic
	  ways of teaching in order to help students to learn.  Open Assessments, in conjunction with Atomic Jolt, 
	  opens the door for friends to share and communities to learn.
